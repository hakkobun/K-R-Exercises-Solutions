This is the Reverse Polish calculator program from chapter 4. I'll copy the scaffolding codes
from the book example. Then slowly add more features along the examples.

Learning goal:
-compiling multiple programs
-learn about header file
-learn about extern/static/scopes of names
-learn to write functions
-learn design of intermediate size program



BUGS:

- handle inputs such as "-.124"
- fix normal subtraction operation
