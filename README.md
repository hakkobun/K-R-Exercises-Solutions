# K-R-Exercises-Solutions
Some solutions that I wrote for the exercises found in the beloved K&amp;R C Programming Language.

I enjoyed writing Exercise 6-2 the most! It was the hardest but it was also the most fun! It was so fun that I didn't even feel the urge to rush. 
The steps I take to tackle 6-2 was
1) make a simple prototype to learn about structs and BST. This v_1 doesn't take into account that the input is a C programming language
2) write out complete state diagram for each algorithms (THIS IS THE MOST HELPFUL THING I'VE LEARNED)
3) apply what I learn from Sandi Metz as much as I could, make the program as modular as I could
4) debugs
