This is the improved Reverse Polish calculator program from chapter 5. 

We're going to receive the ops from the command line arguments instead
Also notice that the command line doesn't support tabs (if it's the command, not the text input mode)

It will support floating points, and 4 operations +, -, *, /

Trying to reuse as much code as possible


Version 0.1 
#No error checking.
#Assumes 5 types of inputs +, -, *, /, float
#Assume legal input

read the arguments one by one
    if it's number put it into the stack
    if it's operator, compute

if there's more than one element left, error

* needs to be passed to the command line as '*', because it's a special character
