I enjoyed writing Exercise 6-2 the most! It was the hardest but it was also the most fun! It was so fun that I didn't even feel the urge to rush. 
The steps I take to tackle 6-2 was
1) make a simple prototype to learn about structs and BST. This v_1 doesn't take into account that the input is a C programming language
2) write out complete state diagram for each algorithms (THIS IS THE MOST HELPFUL THING I'VE LEARNED)
3) apply what I learn from Sandi Metz as much as I could, make the program as modular as I could. 
4) set up the frame of the state diagram. No inner meat needed, just make sure it flows correctly
5) write each basic units first
6) once the simple building blocks are complete, move onto bigger handlers which depend on those smaller pieces
7) go fancy with Datastructures
