Mental:

Be real with yourself,

be in the now,
be with every line, every code

you have done very well, it's not going to be easy
but it's the way to going


#Be EXCITED about the things you don't know
#Have fun
#Be comfort
#Don't do too much!
#Not going all over the places !!
#Focusing on the thing at hand

Code:

seems like you have to use a .c extensions for every
definition functions and variables

Declarations, on the other hand can go in the .h file
